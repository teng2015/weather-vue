#Find the Weather 
##VueJS & Open Weather Map API 
VueJS application that detects a users location based on geolocation. It then provides them with some weather information, in both celcius and fahrenheit. An example can be found [here] (http://s.codepen.io/jw1540/debug/revLaz)

The OWM API is extensive, and more information could be provided.

##Notes for extension 
Change the API to NASA and allow user input on how environmental factors affect health/psychology. 

###Open Weather Map API 
To see what else can be added, search the OWM API docs.
